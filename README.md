# Chroma-Bot
Personal Discord bot to practice Javascript and Node with. 

## 
At the moment, handles very basic commands from users as I try to think of more utilities to add to it and has a cooldown timer for each command.
Some commands:
- !hello : says hi back to the user
- !help : lists all commands that bot is able to execute in a DM to user
- !help [command] : describes what command can do as well as its aliases and cooldown time
- !glados : sends a GLaDOS line to the channel

__Base code was implemented following [Discord.js Guide](https://discordjs.guide/#before-you-begin).__
